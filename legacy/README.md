# Legacy Code Archive

This folder contains the original code files that were replaced during the comprehensive refactoring.

## Archived Files

- `main_original.py` - Original monolithic main.py (689 lines)
- `cli_interface_original.py` - Original CLI interface module
- `config_settings_original.py` - Original configuration management
- `classification_classifier_original.py` - Original classification module  
- `scraping_discovery_original.py` - Original discovery functionality
- `scraping_scraper_original.py` - Original scraping module
- `processing_data_processor_original.py` - Original data processing

## What Was Refactored

The original code had several issues:
- **Monolithic Structure**: Single 689-line main.py file
- **Code Duplication**: Repeated utility functions across modules
- **Poor Separation of Concerns**: Mixed UI, business logic, and data access
- **Tight Coupling**: Direct dependencies between unrelated components
- **Limited Error Handling**: Basic try-catch without proper exception hierarchy

## New Architecture

The refactored code follows SOLID principles with:
- **Clean Architecture**: Layered services with proper abstractions
- **Dependency Injection**: Services receive dependencies, not global state
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module has one clear purpose
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception hierarchy and result patterns
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup and context managers

## Backward Compatibility

All original functionality is preserved through legacy wrapper functions in the new service modules. The new `main.py` can still be used as a drop-in replacement.
